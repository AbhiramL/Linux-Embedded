Flashing image to BBB:

Method 1: Partition sd card yourself and load files into partitions

preparing micro SD card

dmesg    <--- shows system messages, find sd card (sdb or mmcblk0, assumed sdb)
lsblk    <--- shows devices, if partition of the sd card is mounted, use sudo umount to unmount
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sd__ bs=1M count=16   <--- wipes sd card, replace with sdb or sdc
sudo cfdisk /dev/sd_ (replace with sd card name)

-If cfdisk asks you to Select a label type, choose dos. This corresponds to traditional partitions tables that DOS/Windows would understand. gpt partition tables are needed for disks bigger than 2 TB.
-In the cfdisk interface, delete existing partitions, then create only one primary partition, starting from the
beginning, with the following properties:
• Size: 64MB big
• Type: W95 FAT32 (LBA) (c choice)
• Bootable flag enabled
Press Write when you are done.

-write FAT32 filesystem on new FAT32 partition

sudo mkfs.vfat -a -F 32 -n boot /dev/sd_1    <--- sdb1/sdc1 is partition 

-mount and copy uboot files

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/sdcard
sudo mount /dev/sd_1 /mnt/sdcard  (replace sd_ with sdb or sdc)
cd ~/u-boot/
sudo cp MLO u-boot.img /mnt/sdcard
sudo umount /mnt/sdcard

-place sd card on board, reset board, observe changes on serial port on boot up

-Note: create 2nd partition for rootfs(do cfdisk and later mkfs.ext4 on partition), and use busybox to create fs on the partition



Method 2: Using buildroot generated sdcard.img

1. do: sudo dd if=buildroot/output/images/sdcard.img of=/dev/[name of sdcard device, ex. sdc] bs=4M status=progress    
2. boot into sdcard on BBB
3. using cfdisk resize the 2nd partition by adding ~600mb-1Gb, write changes to disk
4. save sdcard.img on the 2nd partition (mount partition and cp file to there)
5. boot into sdcard on BBB, sdcard.img should be in the root folder
6. run command on step 1 but the 'of' target is mmcblk1, skip adding the status flag

Note: step 5, if BBB isnt auto booting from sdcard and is booting from emmc or tftp, run the following on uboot enviornment: 'run bootcmd_mmc0'
